        <p>
          Each track on Spotify is marked with quantative metrics that create a
          unique profle for each song. Each metric is measured on a scale from
          0.0 to 1.0.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Acousticness</h3>
        <p>
          Acousticness measures whether the track is acoustic. A higher score
          reflects a higher confidence that the track is acoustic.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Danceability</h3>
        <p>
          Danceability measures how suitable a track is for dancing based on a
          combination of musical elements. These elements include tempo, rhythm
          stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A higher score
          reflects a song being more danceable.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Energy</h3>
        <p>
          Energy measures the intensity and activity of a song. Some tracks feel
          fast, loud, and noisy while others feel slower and more tones down.
          Dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general
          entropy contribute to this scale. The higher the energy score, the
          more energetic a track is.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Speechiness</h3>
        <p>
          Speechiness measures the presence of spoken words in a track. Talk
          shows, audio books, and poetry will reflect a higher speechiness
          score.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Instrumentalness</h3>
        <p>
          Instrumentalness predicts whether a track contains no vocals. Tracks
          with higher values refect less vocal content such as singing or spoken
          word.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Liveness</h3>
        <p>
          Liveness detects the presence of an audience in the track. Higher
          values reflect a higher confidence that the track was performed live.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Valence</h3>
        <p>
          Valence describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks
          with high valence can be described as being more cheerful, happy, and
          euphoric. Tracks with low valence sound more sad, depressed, and
          angry.
